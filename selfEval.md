# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
    - Remembering the specific syntax for each part. We have covered so much the past few days it's starting to blend together!
- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
    - Note taking is going well. I have quite a few pages of notes I've been referencing often and it's been keeping me from unprodcutive struggle. My most helpful notes are examples of syntax, definitions of methods or vocabulary and little gaps/tricks I find or hear that aren't immediately obvious. 
- What are you noticing that you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
    - I usually try to solve a problem first. Then I reference my notes. Then I reference the lessons. If that still doesn't fix it or I realize I'm trying to do something I haven't seen/done before, I google it. Googling has actually really helped me learn a lot more, not just new methods, but better understanding of how JavaScript interprets the code.
